# Injection
In an injection attack, an attacker supplies untrusted input to a program. This input gets processed by an interpreter as part of a command or query. In turn, this alters the execution of that program.
Injections are amongst the oldest and most dangerous attacks aimed at web applications. They can lead to data theft, data loss, loss of data integrity, denial of service, as well as full system compromise. The primary reason for injection vulnerabilities is usually insufficient user input validation.

This type of attack allows an attacker to inject code into a program or query or inject malware onto a computer in order to execute remote commands that can read or modify a database, or change data on a web site.
  #### An application is vulnerable to attack when:

  - User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.

  - Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.

  - Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.

  - Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.
