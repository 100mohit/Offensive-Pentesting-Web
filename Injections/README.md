# Injection Attack

An injection attack is a malicious code injected in the network which fetched all the information from the database to the attacker. This attack type is considered a major problem in web security. SQL Injection flaws are introduced when software developers create dynamic database queries that include user-supplied input.

Injections are amongst the oldest and most dangerous attacks aimed at web applications and can lead to data theft, data loss, loss of data integrity, denial of service, as well as full system compromise. The primary reason for injection vulnerabilities is usually insufficient user input validation.
